            Perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

            1. **Code Quality**
               - Clean code principles and best practices
               - Proper error handling and edge cases
               - Code readability and maintainability

            2. **Security**
               - Check for potential security vulnerabilities
               - Validate input sanitization
               - Review authentication/authorization logic

            3. **Performance**
               - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
               - Review database queries for efficiency
               - Check for memory leaks or resource issues

            4. **Testing**
               - Verify adequate test coverage
               - Review test quality and edge cases
               - Check for missing test scenarios

            5. **Documentation**
               - Ensure code is properly documented
               - Verify README updates for new features
               - Check API documentation accuracy

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues.

            ## DECISION TABLE OUTPUT (REQUIRED)

            After completing the review, you MUST generate a decision summary table in the following format.
            Post this as a separate PR comment using `gh pr comment`.

            **Decision Rules:**
            - APPROVE MERGE: 0 critical issues AND 0 high issues
            - REQUEST CHANGES: Any critical OR high issues found

            **Table Format (use exactly this markdown structure):**

            ```
            ## 🔍 PR Review Decision

            | Decision | |
            |----------|---------|
            | **Status** | 🟢 **APPROVE MERGE** / 🔴 **REQUEST CHANGES** |

            ---

            ### Criteria Met

            | Criterion | Status | Details |
            |-----------|--------|---------|
            | **Critical Issues** | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL | X critical issues |
            | **High Issues** | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL | X high issues |
            | **Medium Issues** | ✅ PASS / ⚠️ WARN | X medium issues - non-blocking |
            | **Security (OWASP)** | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL | Summary of security checks |
            | **Architecture (SOLID)** | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL | Design pattern assessment |
            | **Test Coverage** | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL | Test coverage assessment |
            | **Type Safety** | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL | Type validation status |

            ---

            ### Summary
            Brief summary of the review findings and any blocking issues.
            ```

            **Status Logic:**
            - Critical Issues: PASS if 0, FAIL if > 0
            - High Issues: PASS if 0, FAIL if > 0
            - Medium Issues: PASS if 0, WARN if > 0 (non-blocking)
            - Security (OWASP): PASS if no OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities found
            - Architecture (SOLID): PASS if code follows SOLID principles
            - Test Coverage: PASS if adequate tests exist for changes
            - Type Safety: PASS if proper type hints/validation (Pydantic for Python, TypeScript types, etc.)
